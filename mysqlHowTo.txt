Using MySQL with Cloud9
This article explains our first iteration of MySQL support in Cloud9. It makes it super easy to install, start and stop a MySQL instance right in your workspace. The nice thing is that every workspace will run a separate database so your projects will never interfere with each other. You can control MySQL with the mysql-ctl command line tool run from the terminal:

# start MySQL. Will create an empty database on first start
$ mysql-ctl start

# stop MySQL
$ mysql-ctl stop

# run the MySQL interactive shell
$ mysql-ctl cli


mysql> show databases;
